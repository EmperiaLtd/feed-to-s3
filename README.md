## Amazon EventBridge Integration Solution for AWS Lambda

This Quick Start demonstrates an integration with AWS Lambda for Amazon EventBridge SaaS Partner Integrations. This solution enables your Amazon EventBridge event bus to trigger a rule that evaluates all events and invokes an AWS Lambda function as a target for matched events. You can use this as a starter project to extend this solution for any scenario that can use Lambda to run code.
